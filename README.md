# Django Restaurant

Welcome to the Django Restaurant project! This project is a simple, yet fully functional web application for a restaurant, built using the Django framework. This project was designed as a learning tool to understand the ins and outs of Django for both client and server-side operations.

## Features

- **About Us Page:** Learn more about the restaurant's story, mission, and team.
- **Menu Selection:** Browse through our offerings and choose from a variety of burgers.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add your favorite items to the cart and review your selections.
- **Cost Calculation:** Automatically calculate the total cost of your order.

## Usage

Once the server is running, navigate through the web application using the navbar to explore different pages. You can add items to your cart from the Menu page and view your selected items and total cost on the Cart page.
